# Nanoprocessor Design Project


This repository contains the VHDL files for the Nanoprocessor Design. The Nanoprocessor is a 4-bit processor that is capable of performing basic arithmetic. The processor is designed to be implemented on a Xilinx Vivado.

<!-- Warning -->
> **Warning:** DO NOT added a `Vivado` project folder to this repository. You may add `VHDL` files only.

## Getting Started

To use the VHDL files in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Open the Vivado software and create a new project.

3. Add the VHDL files from the cloned repository to your project.

4. Customize and configure the design as needed.

5. Compile and synthesize the design in Vivado.

6. Program the target FPGA or generate the required output files.

For detailed instructions on using Vivado and working with VHDL files, refer to the Vivado documentation.
